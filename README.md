## Design 

The design of this portfolio deviates entirely from that which was outlined in the mockup. I did receive approval from the instructor to move forward with a design that I had been working on prior to the class. 

The designs were made using Adobe XD and account for a device-agnostic experience.

## Technology

As of now, this is a completely client-side experience, using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript/jQuery. The intention is to eventually transform this into a PHP/SQL experience that will have a simple, lightweight admin mode to make changes to the site content such as new projects or updates to existing ones.

That, and to manage and serve global site components from one location.
